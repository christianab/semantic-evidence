# SEE design pattern: alternative conclusions #

Evaluation of a given set of data might also lead to conclusions different from those of the authors. Such alternative interpretations can be represented using SEE.

For example, one might dispute that γ-GHS assays are suited to measure GS-activity (EC 6.3.1.2). The γ-GHS assay works by measuring the formation of L-γ-glutamyl hydroxamate rather than glutamine. Tate et al. assert as the objective of its application GS-activity measurement, accepting the formation of the hydroxamate under the conditions of the assay as a proxy for the formation of glutamine and the actual reaction mechanism. Assertion A11 using the property achieves\_objective reflects this acceptance by Tate et al..

Alternatively, a third party could assert that γ-GHS assays merely achieve the less specific objective of measuring γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT) activity (EC 2.3.2.2) (Figure 9, assertion A45). In this case the data reported by Tate et al. can still be used to infer that rat liver is a source of GGT-enzyme (assertion A40).

**Representation of alternative interpretations of reported data.** Alternative interpretations of reported data can be represented as assertions that are made by a third party and linked to assertions reflecting factual descriptions of the reported data. Based on CB's assertion that γ-GHS assays measure GGT activity (A45) - rather than GS-activity - it is inferred that GGT-enzyme has been isolated from rat liver (A40). The corresponding inference chain relies on a number of new curator assertions (A41-A46) and their combination into composite assertions but re-uses assertions on the quantitative data obtained and the procedures conducted by Tate et al. Curator assertions and new inference links are shown in bold.
