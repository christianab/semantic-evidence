=Overview of the SEE approach=

SEE is designed for representation of the evidence that backs a scientific finding. For general background information on evidence and representation of evidence read [Evidence_and_Representation_of_Evidence here].

The SEE approach for representing evidence consists of providing

(i) a formal representation of scientific claims, their provenance and the argumentative structure used to justify them by other claims

(ii) a formal [Representation_of_Assertion_Subjects representation of claim content] and

(iii) a coherent integration of the two.

SEE relies on an abstract model for the representation of claims, provenance and argumentative structure specified in the [RDO_introduction Reasoning and Discourse Ontology (RDO)], a lightweight OWL vocabulary developed for this purpose.

Claim content e.g., _what_ is claimed regarding the properties of biological entities or the results and methods of an investigation is [Representation_of_Assertion_Subjects represented in RDF graphs] by using appropriately defined semantic web resources and design patterns which as a best practice should, if possible, be re-used from existing domain ontologies.

The connection between claims as representational primitives and their content relies on [http://www.websemanticsjournal.org/index.php/ps/article/view/76 named RDF graphs] which enable pointing to collections of RDF-triples or OWL-axioms serialized as such.

==Core design patterns==
With SEE one can coherently represent the entire evidence trail and how it is communicated. Its design patterns enable representation of
  * individual scientific claims along with their subject and provenance
  * argumentative structures within and across publications
  * attribution and consecutive layers of attribution (e.g., citing what others have asserted)
  * the acceptance of what others have asserted (e.g., a curator evaluates a scientific article and enters some of the reported findings into a database)
  * the drawing of own conclusions (e.g., alternative interpretations of published data)

==Applying SEE for evaluation of scientific findings==
SEE-based accounts can be used to evaluate the evidence which is used to justify a scientific claim w.r.t
  * the observations and techniques used
  * the informations sources used and assumptions made
  * the sources through which the finding has been communicated
  * the agents which have made the claim

In addition, evidence-related information such as
  * all assertions which are directly or indirectly used to infer a given assertion
  * all assertions made in a given report
  * all assertions made by a given agent
  * all assertions on the same subject
  * all agents making assertions on a given subject
can easily be queried.

==Use cases==
Representations which use SEE or its underlying model could be productive in a variety of use cases requiring careful examination or recording of evidence, e.g.,
  * providing supporting background information for biomedical knowledge bases,
  * creating digital abstracts of research publications,
  * adding a claim-level perspective on research publications which could be used by publishers, in bibliographic databases and in personal bibliography managers,
  * providing open linked data which can be integrated on an informed basis using varying, application specific evidence criteria.
