#summary Background information about evidence

=Scientific evidence==

Scientific evidence, as a concept, can be defined as *information that is relevant to assess the likelihood that a particular scientific idea is correct*.

===Representation of the corresponding evidence is therefore key to evaluating hypotheses and assessing claims contained in scientific articles, databases or any other repository of scientific information.====

*Scientific knowledge* is often highly *context-dependent* and *based on evidence obtained from the skilful combination and evaluation of individual results*, involving, among other aspects, diverse experimental and computational techniques, different forms of interpretation, and various inference schemes.

Consequently, all those aspects - the *materials, methods and information sources used, the observations made, the reasoning employed and the context-specific assumptions made - are important for comprehensive evidence accounts*.

Likewise, when data, often from disparate sources, is integrated to study complex systems an account of the evidence that was used to infer a model's properties and those of and among its components is critical for correct and transparent understanding of that model.

==Representing scientific evidence==
SEE represents evidence for a scientific claim in terms of the *argumentative structure of its supporting background* using *four minimal elements* for representing:

  # *scientific claims* and the *argumentative structure* used to justify them by other claims
  # the *subjects of the claims* i.e. of that _what_ is claimed with regard to a subject of inquiry
  # the *agents* making the claims and arguments
  # the *sources* in which claims were originally made e.g., the original scientific articles or database records.
