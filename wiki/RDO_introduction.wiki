==Reasoning and Discourse Ontology (RDO)==
RDO provides *a lightweight OWL-vocabulary* for representing scientific claims, their subjects (i.e. what the claims are about), the argumentative relations between claims and claim provenance.

RDO is the *backbone of the SEE approach* for representing scientific evidence.

The *current version* of RDO is available [http://semantic-evidence.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ontology/rdo.owl here].

The *typical scenario* that underlies the constructs defined in RDO is the following: Agents (e.g., individual scientists) make claims on particular occasions (e.g., as authors of a published scientific article) about a subject of inquiry. The subject of the claim - i.e. what is claimed - is communicated in some linguistic form, often as part of a more comprehensive report (e.g., a scientific article) authored by the agents. Claims are usually justified by other claims the subject of which has been accepted as true, usually on the basis of yet other claims.

==The RDO core model==
RDO rests on the *distinction of a claim, its subject and the linguistic form in which this subject is communicated* and is centered around the concept of an assertion: instances of the class {{{rdo:assertion}}} ({{{courier}}} typeface denotes OWL classes, _{{{courier in italics}}}_ denotes OWL properties) represent particular claims made by particular agents on a particular occasion that a particular proposition, the subject of the claim, is true.

Propositions, in our model, are represented by the class {{{rdo:proposition}}} and taken to represent the semantic content of contextualized lexical entities formulated in some natural or artificial language.

The lexical entities by which the subject of a claim and propositions and reports in general are formulated are represented using the class {{{rdo:text}}}.

The class {{{rdo:report}}} represents accounts intended to accurately describe an event or situation. Thus, scientific journal articles or database records as typical sources of assertions are examples of a {{{rdo:report}}}.

{{{rdo:agent}}} is used to represent individual persons, corporate bodies or information processing devices as roleplayers in the creation of reports or assertions.

RDO specifies various properties to represent the relations between instances of these classes. In particular, argumentative structure is captured by the property _{{{rdo:is_inferred_from}}}_ which relates an instance of assertion to another if and only if the former is, directly or indirectly, inferred from the latter (and possibly other premises).

*Core classes and properties in RDO.* Boxes denote labelled classes, arrows denote labelled properties, direction of arrows denotes property domains and ranges. Asterisk: property has domain and range-specific sub-properties.
