# Semantic EvidencE (SEE) #
Semantic EvidencE (SEE) provides resources for generating **expressive**, **extensible** and **computationally accessible accounts of scientific evidence** using semantic web techniques.

SEE is designed to enable Semantic Web compatible **representation of the fabric of observations, materials & methods, assumptions, reasoning and information sources** examined by researchers **to establish or evaluate** a scientific finding.

SEE represents **evidence in terms of the argumentative structure of the supporting background** for a claim and **enables** representation of **consecutive layers of interpretation and attribution** and **different evaluations based on the same data.**

[Read more](SEE_overview.md) about SEE.

SEE relies on **RDO (Reasoning and Discourse Ontology)** a lightweight OWL-vocabulary for representation of the relations among
  * scientific **claims**
  * **argumentative** structure
  * **sources** through which claims are communicated (e.g., scientific articles, database records)
  * **agents** making the claims (e.g., scientists, corporate bodies, information processing devices)

The current version of RDO is available [here](http://semantic-evidence.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ontology/rdo.owl).

**Note:** As a result of the publisher's production process the courier typeface of RDO properties is lost in the PDF version of this article. In the PDF, in contrast to the HTML version, RDO properties are displayed only in the italicized typeface of the containing paragraph.
Moreover, in the version rendered for handheld devices the courier typeface for both RDO classes and properties is lost. There they appear in the normal and italicized typeface of the containing paragraph, respectively.
