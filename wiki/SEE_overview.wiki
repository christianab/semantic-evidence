=Overview of the SEE approach=

SEE is designed for representation of the evidence that backs a scientific finding. For general background information on evidence and representation of evidence read [Evidence_and_Representation_of_Evidence here].

The SEE approach for representing evidence consists of providing

(i) a formal representation of scientific claims, their provenance and the argumentative structure used to justify them by other claims

(ii) a formal [Representation_of_Assertion_Subjects representation of claim content] and

(iii) a coherent integration of the two.

SEE relies on an abstract model for the representation of claims, provenance and argumentative structure specified in the [RDO_introduction Reasoning and Discourse Ontology (RDO)], a lightweight OWL vocabulary developed for this purpose.

Claim content e.g., _what_ is claimed regarding the properties of biological entities or the results and methods of an investigation is [Representation_of_Assertion_Subjects represented in RDF graphs] by using appropriately defined semantic web resources and design patterns which as a best practice should, if possible, be re-used from existing domain ontologies.

The connection between claims as representational primitives and their content relies on [http://www.websemanticsjournal.org/index.php/ps/article/view/76 named RDF graphs] which enable pointing to collections of RDF-triples or OWL-axioms serialized as such.
