#Introduction to the Reasoning and Discourse Ontology (RDO).

= Reasoning and Discourse Ontology (RDO)=

RDO provides a lightweight OWL-vocabulary for representing scientific claims, their subjects (i.e. what the claims are about), the argumentative relations between claims and claim provenance.

RDO is the backbone of the SEE approach for representing scientific evidence.

The current version of RDO is available [http://semantic-evidence.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ontology/rdo.owl here].

The typical scenario that underlies the constructs defined in RDO is the following: Agents (e.g., individual scientists) make claims on particular occasions (e.g., as authors of a published scientific article) about a subject of inquiry. The subject of the claim - i.e. what is claimed - is communicated in some linguistic form, often as part of a more comprehensive report (e.g., a scientific article) authored by the agents. Claims are usually justified by other claims the subject of which has been accepted as true, usually on the basis of yet other claims.
