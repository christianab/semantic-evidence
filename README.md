## What is Semantic EvidencE?
**Semantic EvidencE (SEE)** provides resources for generating **expressive**, **extensible** and **computationally accessible** accounts of scientific evidence using Semantic Web techniques.

SEE is designed to enable Semantic Web compatible **representation of the fabric of observations, materials & methods, assumptions, reasoning and information sources** examined by researchers **to establish or evaluate** a scientific finding.

SEE represents **evidence in terms of the argumentative structure of the supporting background** for a claim. It **enables** representation of **consecutive layers of interpretation and attribution and different evaluations based on the same data**.

[Read more](../wiki/SEE_overview.md) about SEE.

SEE relies on **RDO (Reasoning and Discourse Ontology)** a lightweight OWL-vocabulary for representation of the relations among

* scientific **claims**
* **argumentative** structure
* **sources** through which claims are communicated (e.g., scientific articles, database records)
* **agents** making the claims (e.g., scientists, corporate bodies, information processing devices) 

The current version of RDO is available [here](../master/ontology/rdo.owl).
