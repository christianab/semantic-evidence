=Scientific evidence==

Scientific evidence, as a concept, can be defined as *information that is relevant to assess the likelihood that a particular scientific idea is correct*.

===Representation of the corresponding evidence is therefore key to evaluating hypotheses and assessing claims contained in scientific articles, databases or any other repository of scientific information.====

*Biomedical knowledge* is often highly *context-dependent* and *based on evidence obtained from the skilful combination and evaluation of individual results*, involving, among other aspects, a range of model organisms, diverse experimental and computational techniques, different forms of interpretation, and various inference schemes.

Consequently, all those aspects - the *materials, methods and information sources used, the observations made, the reasoning employed and the context-specific assumptions made - are important for comprehensive evidence accounts*. Likewise, when data, often from disparate sources, is integrated to study complex biological systems an account of the evidence that was used to infer a model's properties and those of and among its components is critical for correct and transparent understanding of that model.

==Representing scientific evidence==
SEE represents evidence for a scientific claim in terms of the *argumentative structure of its supporting background* using *four minimal elements* for representing:

  # *scientific claims* and the *argumentative structure* used to justify them by other claims
  # the *subjects of the claims* i.e. of that _what_ is claimed with regard to a subject of inquiry
  # the *agents* making the claims and arguments
  # the *sources* in which claims were originally made e.g., the original scientific articles or database records.

=Overview of the SEE approach==

Based on the foregoing, the SEE approach for representing evidence consists of providing

(i) a formal representation of scientific claims, their provenance and the argumentative structure used to justify them by other claims

(ii) a formal representation of claim content and

(iii) a coherent integration of the two.

SEE relies on an abstract model for the representation of claims, provenance and argumentative structure specified in the [RDO_introduction Reasoning and Discourse Ontology (RDO)], a lightweight OWL vocabulary developed for this purpose.

Claim content e.g., _what_ is claimed regarding the properties of biological entities or the results and methods of an investigation is represented in RDF graphs by using appropriately defined semantic web resources and design patterns which as a best practice should, if possible, be re-used from existing domain ontologies.

The connection between claims as representational primitives and their content relies on named RDF graphs which enable pointing to collections of RDF-triples or OWL-axioms serialized as such.
