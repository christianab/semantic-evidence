=SEE design pattern: Representing consecutive layers of attribution=

Consecutive layers of attribution occur *whenever a third party makes assertion on what another agent has asserted*.

For example, when a curator evaluates a scientific article and reports on the author's assertions (without necessarily affirming them).

In SEE consecutive layers of attribution are represented as *assertions the subject of which is about other assertions*. This design pattern allows for representing *arbitrary many consecutive layers of attribution*.

*Representation of consecutive layers of attribution.* CB's assertion that 'Tate and co-workers assert that assay-1 was a gamma-GHS assay in their 1972 report' is represented as an {{{rdo:assertion}}} instance linked to a {{{rdo:proposition}}} instance whose named graph representation relates the {{{rdo:assertion}}} instance A10 to the Tate 1972 report via the _{{{rdo:is_assertion_made_in}}}_ property.
